## Abstract:

The present research work studies the way texts are clustered with the generation of Embeddings. In particular, it focuses on using different methods to apply supervised and unsupervised models so that efficient results can be obtained when encountering automatic clustering tasks.

Five Datasets were worked with, and as a result of the implementation of the supervised models it was determined that the best Embedding is FastText implemented with Gensim and applied in models based on boosting. For the unsupervised models the best Embedding is Glove applied in neural network models with AutoEncoder and K-means layer.
